### CSC108 Assignment 1

#### Goals
* Practice learning about a problem domain in order to write code about that domain.
* Use the Function Design Recipe to plan, implement, and test functions.
* Write function bodies using variables, numeric types, strings, and conditional statements. (You can do this whole assignment with only the concepts from Weeks 1, 2, and 3 of CSC108.)
* Learn to use Python 3, Wing101, provided starter code, a type-check module, and other tools.

#### Tweet Analyzer
This assignment is based on the social network site Twitter. Twitter allows users to read and post messages (called tweets) that are between 1 and 140 characters long (inclusive). In this assignment, you will be writing functions that are imagined to be part of the programs that manage Twitter feeds.
